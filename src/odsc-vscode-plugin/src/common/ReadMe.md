# Common code
This folder contains generic code that's common to many projects.
Examples:
- file operations
- generic dialog boxes
- common string manipulation

DO NOT:
- add any project specific code
  - for example: DataScience artifact code. yes, that's about files too, but is described in terms of DataScience domain language - that's why it does not belong here.
